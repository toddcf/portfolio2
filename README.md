## Technologies Used

## This Iteration

### All

- All card footers: Make all icons the same size. (May happen automatically when I recrop them in Photoshop.)

### Header

- Try using rows and columns to fix the iPhone issue.

### Nav

- Get it to automatically close when a link is clicked, WITHOUT screwing up the scrolling feature.

### Proficiencies

- Make all logos the same size.
- .bounceInUp when scrolled to.

### UI/UX Projects

- Each card:
  - Change each img to a gif.
  - Showmore dimensions: 1350 x 900
  

### JavaScript & jQuery Projects

- Done!

### Education & Certificates

- Style and standardize all cards.
	- Images:
		- Hover: MD Bootstrap zoom effect.
	- Make card-headers and card-titles the same height, even if some take up one line and others take up two.
	- Buttons:
		- Choose color.
		- Add waves effect when clicked.

### About

## Mobile Responsiveness

- Check each section at xs breakpoint.
- Check each section at sm breakpoint.
- Check each section at md breakpoint.
- Check each section at lg breakpoint.
- Check each section at xl breakpoint.

## Final Cleanup

- Add Google Analytics, but only right before deployment. (Don't want to screw things up with the gh-pages version.)

## Future Iterations

- Have each mobile-responsive row of cards fadeUp one after the other when scrolled to:
	- sm breakpoint: 1 card across:
	  - Add class for .fadeInUp when scrolled to.
	  - No delay.
	- md breakpoint: 2 cards across:
	  - Add class for .fadeInUp when scrolled to.
	  - Add class for 0.5s delay on second card.
	- lg breakpoint: 3 cards across:
	  - .fadeInUp when scrolled to.
	  - 0.5s delay on second card.
	  - 1s delay on third card.
