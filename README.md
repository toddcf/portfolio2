## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Bootstrap 4 Beta
- jQuery

## This Iteration

- Host Lato font.

## Future Iterations

- Have each mobile-responsive row of cards fadeUp one after the other when scrolled to:
	- sm breakpoint: 1 card across:
	  - Add class for .fadeInUp when scrolled to.
	  - No delay.
	- md breakpoint: 2 cards across:
	  - Add class for .fadeInUp when scrolled to.
	  - Add class for 0.5s delay on second card.
	- lg breakpoint: 3 cards across:
	  - .fadeInUp when scrolled to.
	  - 0.5s delay on second card.
	  - 1s delay on third card.

### Nav

- Get it to automatically close when a link is clicked, WITHOUT screwing up the scrolling feature.

### Proficiencies

- .bounceInUp when scrolled to.

### UI/UX Projects && JavaScript & jQuery Projects

- Each card:
	- Change each img to a gif.
	- Showmore dimensions: 1350 x 900
	- Footer: Make each coding icon the same size.

### Education & Certificates

- Style and standardize all cards.
	- Make card-headers and card-titles the same height, even if some take up one line and others take up two.
	- Buttons: Add waves effect when clicked.
	- Images: MD Bootstrap zoom effect when hovered.

### Connect

- Fix the shape of the href links. (Right now, the text is inside a div that takes up 100% of its container, while the icon is only as wide as what you see.)
